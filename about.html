          communities have engaged in the transcultural exchange of dance,
          movement, and music, claiming and maneuvering the internet as a space
          for visible, culturally coded play, political organization, and
          innovation.

          <span class="emphasis"> NIC Kay</span> is an interdisciplinary artist, performer, and conceptual
            choreographer who works with movement to explore relationality and
            yearning. They employ choreography to excavate relationships between
            spaces, bodies, and objects in order to shift meaning and change
            perceptions of place. Their works have been performed nationally and
            internationally in spaces including Akademie der Künste, Berlin,
            Germany; Buddies in Bad Times Theatre, Toronto, Canada; Encuentro
            19, Mexico City, Mexico; Institute of Contemporary Arts, London,
            United Kingdom; Portland Institute of Contemporary Art, Portland,
            OR; and University of Arts, Zürich, Switzerland. NIC was a
            Foundation for Contemporary Arts Grants to Artists Award (2020).
            They published their first book, Cotton Dreams, with Candor Arts in
            2020. NIC is a Black queer trans non-binary person.
